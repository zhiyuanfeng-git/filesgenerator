# filesgenerator
This is a file parser and generator tool. It is based on the package called pargen that I am working on. This tool is the best candidate for verifying and improving an event-driven system. As an input,reading a file could be as a 'parser action',then after parsing,generating some new files,which could perfectly explain the work of a 'generator'.
